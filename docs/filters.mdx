# Filtering Packages

Each Melos command can be used alongside the following global filters:

## --no-private

Exclude private packages (`publish_to: none`). They are included by default.

```bash
melos bootstrap --no-private
```

## --published

Filter packages where the current local package version exists on pub.dev.

```bash
melos bootstrap --published
```

Use `--no-published` to filter packages that have not had their current version published yet.

## --scope

Include only packages with names matching the given glob. This option can be repeated.

```bash
# Run `flutter build ios` on all packages with "example" in the package name
melos exec --scope="*example*" -- flutter build ios
```

## --ignore

Exclude packages with names matching the given glob. This option can be repeated.

```bash
# Run `flutter build ios` on all packages but ignore those whose packages names contain "internal"
melos exec --ignore="*internal*" -- flutter build ios
```

## --since

Only include packages that have been changed since the specified `ref`, e.g. a commit sha or git tag.

```bash
# Run `flutter build ios` on all packages that have been changed since the specified commit hash
melos exec --since=<commit hash> -- flutter build ios
```

## --dir-exists

Include only packages where a specific directory exists inside the package.

```bash
# Only bootstrap packages with an example directory
melos bootstrap --dir-exists="example"
```

## --file-exists

Include only packages where a specific file exists in the package.

```bash
# Only bootstrap packages with an README.md file
melos bootstrap --file-exists="README.md"
```

## --flutter

Filter packages where the package depends on the Flutter SDK.

```bash
melos exec --flutter -- flutter test
```

Use `--no-flutter` to filter packages that do not depend on the Flutter SDK.

## --depends-on

Include only packages that depend on specific dependencies.

```bash
melos exec --depends-on="flutter" --depends-on="firebase_core" -- flutter test
```

Use `--no-depends-on` to filter packages that do not depend on the given dependencies.
