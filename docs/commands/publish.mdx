# Publish Command

> Supports all [Melos filtering](/filters) flags.

Publish any unpublished packages or package versions in your repository to pub.dev. `dry-run` is enabled by default.

```bash
melos publish
```

## --dry-run

Flags whether to publish the packages as a dry run (validate but do not publish). Defaults to `true`.

```bash
# Publish packages with dry run
melos publish --dry-run

# Publish packages without dry run
melos publish --no-dry-run
```

Use `--no-dry-run` to disable.

Publish any unpublished packages or package versions in your repository to pub.dev. `dry-run` is enabled by default.

```bash
melos publish
```

## --git-tag-version (-t)

Add any missing git tags for release. Tags are only created if --no-dry-run is also set.

```bash
melos publish --no-dry-run --git-tag-version
```

Note that tags are automatically created as part of `melos version` (unless `--no-git-tag-version` is specified when running the version command) so this is usually not required on `melos publish` unless you're doing a manual version and publish of packages.
