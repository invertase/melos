# Publish Command

<Info>Supports all [Melos filtering](/filters) flags.</Info>

Publish any unpublished packages or package versions in your repository to
pub.dev. `dry-run` is enabled by default.

```bash
melos publish
```

## --dry-run

Flags whether to publish the packages as a dry run (validate but do not
publish). Defaults to `true`.

```bash
# Publish packages with dry run
melos publish --dry-run

# Publish packages without dry run
melos publish --no-dry-run
```

Use `--no-dry-run` to disable.

Publish any unpublished packages or package versions in your repository to
pub.dev. `dry-run` is enabled by default.

```bash
melos publish
```

## --git-tag-version (-t)

Add any missing git tags for release. Tags are only created if --no-dry-run is
also set.

```bash
melos publish --no-dry-run --git-tag-version
```

Note that tags are automatically created as part of `melos version` (unless
`--no-git-tag-version` is specified when running the version command) so this is
usually not required on `melos publish` unless you're doing a manual version and
publish of packages.

## Hooks

Melos supports various command [lifecycle hooks](/configuration/scripts#hooks)
that can be defined in your `melos.yaml`.

For example, if you need to run something such as a build runner automatically
before `melos publish` is run and then remove the generated files after
publishing is done, you can add `pre` and `post` hook scripts to your
`melos.yaml` file:

```yaml
# melos.yaml
# ...
command:
  publish:
    hooks:
      pre: dart pub run build_runner build
      post: dart pub run build_runner clean
# ...
```

The pre-hook will run before `melos publish` and the post-hook will run after
`melos publish` is done. It only runs once, even if multiple packages are
published and it also runs when you are doing a `dry-run` publish.
You can detect whether it is a dry-run by checking the `MELOS_PUBLISH_DRY_RUN`
environment variable.
