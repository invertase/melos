# Run Command

Run a [script](/configuration/scripts) by name defined in the workspace
root `pubspec.yaml` config file.

```bash
melos run <name>
```

## --no-select

Skips the prompt to select a package (if defined in the script configuration).
Filters defined in the script's "packageFilters" options will however still be
applied.

```bash
melos run <name> --no-select
```

## --list

Displays all scripts defined in the Melos workspace.

```bash
melos run --list
```

Use `--json` to output the list in JSON format.

```bash
melos run --list --json
```
Using `--include-private` ignores the private configuration on scripts.
The private scripts are shown in prompts, listings and they can be executed directly.

```bash
melos run --list --json
```

### --group

Filters scripts to include only those that belong to the specified group.

```bash
melos run --group <group>
```
