# Run Command

Run a [script](/configuration/scripts) by name defined in the workspace
root `pubspec.yaml` config file.

```bash
melos run <name>
```

## --no-select

Skips the prompt to select a package (if defined in the script configuration).
Filters defined in the script's "packageFilters" options will however still be
applied.

```bash
melos run <name> --no-select
```
