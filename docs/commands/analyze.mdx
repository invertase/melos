## --fatal-infos
Enforces a strict analysis by treating info-level issues as critical errors.

```bash
melos analyze --fatal-infos

## --fatal-warnings
Enables treating warnings as fatal errors. When enabled, any warning will cause the analyzer to fail.

```bash
melos analyze --fatal-warnings
```

## --no-fatal-warnings
This option configures the melos analyze command to ignore warnings, allowing the analysis process to complete successfully even if warnings are present.

```bash
melos analyze --no-fatal-warnings
```

## concurrency (-c)

Defines the max concurrency value of how many packages will execute the command in at any one time. Defaults to `1`.

```bash
# Set a 5 concurrency
melos analyze -c 5
```
