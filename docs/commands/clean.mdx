# Clean Command

> Supports all [Melos filtering](/filters) flags.

This command cleans the current workspace and all its packages of temporary pub & generated Melos IDE files.

```bash
melos clean
```

These files include;

- `{packageRoot}/.packages`
- `{packageRoot}/.flutter-plugins`
- `{packageRoot}/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`
- `{packageRoot}/.dart_tool/package_config.json`
- `{packageRoot}/.dart_tool/package_config_subset`
- `{packageRoot}/.dart_tool/version`
- `{packageRoot}/melos_{packageName}.iml`
- `{workspaceRoot}/melos_{workspaceName}.iml`
- `{workspaceRoot}/.idea/runConfigurations/melos_*.xml`

This can be useful to give your workspace a 'fresh start', e.g.;

```bash
melos clean
melos bootstrap
```

## Combining with filters

Clean supports [all package filtering options](/filters), therefore if you wanted to you could clean only a specific subset of your packages, for example:

```bash
# Only clean Flutter packages or apps.
melos clean --flutter
```

## Adding a postclean lifecycle script

Melos supports various command lifecycle hooks that can be defined in your `melos.yaml`.

For example, if you needed to cleanup any generated files, e.g. from a build runner, automatically after `melos clean` is ran, you can add a `postclean` script.

```yaml
# melos.yaml
# ...
scripts:
  postclean: rm packages/foo/lib/src/generated_file.g.dart
# ...
```

Another common use case is to run `flutter clean` in all Flutter packages;

```yaml
# melos.yaml
# ...
scripts:
  # Runs "flutter clean" in all Flutter packages (`--flutter`)
  # with a concurrency of 3 at a time (`--concurrency=3`).
  postclean: >
    melos exec --flutter --concurrency=3 -- "flutter clean"

# ...
```
