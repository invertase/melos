# Exec Command

Execute an arbitrary command in each package.

```bash
melos exec
# e.g. melos exec -- pub global run tuneup check
```

## concurrency (-c)

Defines the max concurrency value of how many packages will execute the command in at any one time. Defaults to `5`.

```bash
# Set a 1 concurrency
melos exec -c 1  -- "dart analyze ."
```

## --fail-fast

Whether exec should fail fast and not execute the script in further packages if the script fails in an individual package.
Defaults to `false`.

```bash
# Fail fast
melos exec --fail-fast -- "dart analyze ."
```
