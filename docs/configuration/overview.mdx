# Configuration Overview

Every project requires a `melos.yaml` project in the root. The below outlines
all the configurable fields and their purpose.

## `name`

> required

The name of this project for display purposes within IO environments and IDEs.

```yaml
name: My Awesome Project
```

## `repository`

The URL of the git repository that contains the Melos workspace.

Supported hosts:

- GitHub
- GitLab (https://gitlab.com)

```yaml
repository: https://github.com/invertase/melos
```

## `sdkPath`

> optional

Path to the Dart/Flutter SDK that should be used.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the `melos.yaml` file.

To use the system-wide SDK, provide the special value "auto".

If the SDK path is specified though multiple mechanisms, the precedence from
highest to lowest is:

1. `--sdk-path` global command line option
2. `MELOS_SDK_PATH` environment variable
3. `sdkPath` in `melos.yaml`

```yaml
sdkPath: .fvm/flutter_sdk
```

## `packages`

> required

A list of paths to local packages that are included in the Melos workspace. Each
entry can be a specific path or a [glob] pattern.

```yaml
packages:
  # e.g. include all packages inside the `packages` directory at any level
  - packages/**
  # e.g. include all packages inside the `packages` directory that are direct children
  - packages/*
  # e.g. include the package in the workspace root
  - .
```

> You can also reduce the scope of packages on a per-command basis via the
> [`--scope` filter](/filters#scope) flag.

## `ignore`

> optional

A list of paths to local packages that are excluded from the Melos workspace.
Each entry can be a specific path or a [glob] pattern.

```yaml
ignore:
  # e.g. ignore example apps
  - 'packages/**/example'
```

> You can also expand the scope of ignored packages on a per-command basis via
> the [`--scope` filter](/filters#scope) flag.

## `ide`

> optional

Configuration for realting to IDE support.

## `ide/intellij/enabled`

Whether to generate IntelliJ IDEA config files to improve the developer
experience when working in a Melos workspace.

The default is `true`.

```yaml
ide:
  intellij: false # set to false to override default and disable
```

## `ide/intellij/moduleNamePrefix`

Used when generating IntelliJ project modules files. This value specifies a
string to prepend to a package's IntelliJ module name. Use this to avoid name
collisions with other IntelliJ modules you may already have in place.

The default is 'melos\_'.

## `scripts`

> optional

Define custom scripts that can be executed in the workspace via the
[`melos run`](/commands/run) command.

Learn more about defining scripts [here](/configuration/scripts).

## `command`

> optional

Configuration relating to specific Melos commands such as versioning.

### `command/bootstrap`

Configuration for the `bootstrap` command.

### `command/bootstrap/usePubspecOverrides`

Whether to use `pubspec_overrides.yaml` for overriding workspace dependencies
during development.

Enabling this option requires Dart **2.17.0** or greater.

When this option is enabled, Melos will generate a `pubspec_overrides.yaml` file
in the root of every package during bootstrapping. This file should not be
tracked in version control and should be added to `.gitignore`.

This mechanism has the advantage that it does not conflict with other tooling
such as the `dart` and `flutter` tools and IDE plugins, when compared to the
original mechanism used to link local packages.

### `command/bootstrap/runPubGetInParallel`

Whether to run `pub get` in parallel during bootstrapping.

The default is `true`.

### `command/bootstrap/runPubGetOffline`

Whether to attempt to run `pub get` in offline mode during bootstrapping.

Useful in closed network environments with pre-populated pubcaches.

The default is `false`.

### `command/version`

Configuration for the `version` command.

### `command/version/message`

A template for the commit message, that is generated by `melos version`.

Templates must use mustache syntax and have the following variables available:

- `new_package_versions`: A list of the versioned packages and their new
versions.

The default is:

```
chore(release): publish packages

{new_package_versions}
```

```yaml
command:
  version:
    message: |
      chore: cut package releases 🎉

      {new_package_versions}
```

### `command/version/branch`

If specified, prevents `melos version` from being used inside branches other
than the one specified.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    branch: main
```

### `command/version/includeScopes`

Whether to include conventional commit scopes in the generated CHANGELOG.md.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    includeScopes: true
```

### `command/version/includeCommitId`

Whether to add short commit ids to commits (no links) in the CHANGELOG.md that
is generated by `melos version`.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    includeCommitId: true
```

### `command/version/linkToCommits`

Whether to add links to commits in the CHANGELOG.md that is generated by
`melos version`.

Enabling this option, requires [`repository`](/configuration/overview#repository) to be specified.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    linkToCommits: true
```

### `command/version/workspaceChangelog`

Whether to additionally build a CHANGELOG.md at the root of the workspace when
running `melos version`.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    workspaceChangelog: true
```

### `command/version/updateGitTagRefs`

Whether to update package version tags in git dependencies of dependents when
versioning packages.

See the
[automated releases documentation](/guides/automated-releases#git-hosted-packages)
for more information.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    updateGitTagRefs: true
```

### `command/version/releaseUrl`

Whether to generate and print a link to the prefilled release creation page for each package after
versioning. Defaults to `false`.
