# Workspace Scripts

Workspace scripts can be executed with `melos run` or will be executed as hooks before/after some
specific Melos commands.

With the simple syntax, only the name of the script and the command to execute needs to be specified:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello: echo 'Hello World'
```

The extends syntax allows for a more complex configuration of a script:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    name: hey
    description: 'Greet the world'
    run: echo '$GREETING World'
    env:
      GREETING: 'Hey'
```

Scripts are executed in a shell. On Windows the shell is `cmd.exe` and on all other platforms
it is `sh`.

If multiple commands are being executed in a script and no further commands should be executed
after a command has failed, connect the commands with `&&`:

```yaml
scripts:
  prepare: melos bootstrap && melos run build
```

## `scripts/*/name`

A unique identifier for the script.

## `scripts/*/description`

A short description, shown when using `melos run` with no argument.

## `scripts/*/run`

The command to execute.

## `scripts/*/exec`

Execute a script in multiple packages through `melos exec`.

This options must either contain the command to execute in multiple packages or the options for the
`melos exec` command.

When using the default options for `melos exec`, it's easiest to specify the command in the `exec`
option:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    exec: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
```

If you need to provide options for the `exec` command, specify them in the `exec` option and
specify the command in the `run` option:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    run: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
    exec:
      concurrency: 1
```

See the [`select-package`](/configuration/scripts#scriptsselect-package) option for filtering the packages to execute
the command in.

## `scripts/*/exec/concurrency`

Defines the max concurrency value of how many packages will execute the command in at any one time.
Defaults to `5`.

## `scripts/*/exec/failFast`

Whether `exec` should fail fast and not execute the script in further packages if the script fails
in an individual package.
Defaults to `false`.

## `scripts/*/env`

A map of environment variables that will be passed to the executed command.

## `scripts/*/select-package`

The [`melos exec`](/commands/exec) command allows you to execute a command for multiple packages.
When used in a script, you can declare filter options in the `select-packages` section.

The `hello_flutter` script below is only executed in Flutter packages:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello_flutter:
    exec: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
    select-package:
      flutter: true
```

See the [global options](/filters) for a list of supported filters.

When running a script that uses `select-package`, you will be prompted to select
the package to execute the script in. If you want to skip this prompt and run the script in all
packages, use the `--no-select` option.

# Hooks

Certain Melos commands support running scripts before and after the command is executed.
Before hooks have the same name as the command. Post hooks have the name of the command prefixed with `post`:

```yaml
scripts:
  bootstrap: echo `bootstrap command is running...`
  postbootstrap: echo `bootstrap command is done`
```

Currently, the following Melos commands support hooks:

- [`bootstrap`](/commands/bootstrap)
- [`clean`](/commands/clean)
- [`version`](/commands/version)
