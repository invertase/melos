  Defining workspace scripts in Melos via the `melos.yaml` scripts definition.

# Workspace Scripts

Workspace scripts can be executed with `melos run` or will be executed as
lifecycle hooks of some specific Melos commands.

With the simple syntax, only the name of the script and the command to execute
needs to be specified:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello: echo 'Hello World'
```

The extends syntax allows for a more complex configuration of a script:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    name: hey
    description: Greet the world
    run: echo '$GREETING World'
    env:
      GREETING: 'Hey'
```

Scripts are executed in a shell. On Windows the shell is `cmd.exe` and on all
other platforms it is `sh`.

If multiple commands are being executed in a script and no further commands
should be executed after a command has failed, connect the commands with `&&`:

```yaml
scripts:
  prepare: melos bootstrap && melos run build
```

## name

A unique identifier for the script.

## description

A short description, shown when using `melos run` with no argument.

## run

The command to execute.

## steps

Enables the combination of multiple scripts within a single script definition
for complex workflows. In the example below, the pre-commit script is
configured to sequentially invoke a simple command echo 'hello world',
followed by Melos commands: format and analyze, each with specific arguments.

```yaml
scripts:
  pre-commit:
    description: pre-commit git hook script
    steps:
      - echo 'hello world'
      - format --output none --set-exit-if-changed
      - analyze --fatal-infos
```

Note: When utilizing the `steps`, it's important to understand that options 
related to exec — such as concurrency — or `packageFilters` cannot be directly 
applied within the steps configuration. Instead, these options should be 
configured in the individual scripts that are being called as part of the step.

## exec

Execute a script in multiple packages through `melos exec`.

This options must either contain the command to execute in multiple packages or
the options for the `melos exec` command.

When using the default options for `melos exec`, it's easiest to specify the
command in the `exec` option:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    exec: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
```

If you need to provide options for the `exec` command, specify them in the
`exec` option and specify the command in the `run` option:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    run: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
    exec:
      concurrency: 1
```

See the [`packageFilters`](/configuration/scripts#packagefilters) option for
filtering the packages to execute the command in.

### concurrency

Defines the max concurrency value of how many packages will execute the command
in at any one time. Defaults to `5`.

### failFast

Whether `exec` should fail fast and not execute the script in further packages
if the script fails in an individual package. Defaults to `false`.

### orderDependents

Whether `exec` should order the execution of the script in multiple packages
based on the dependency graph of the packages. The script will be executed in
leaf packages first and then in packages that depend on them and so on. This is
useful for example, for a script that generates code in multiple packages, which
depend on each other. Defaults to `false`.

## env

A map of environment variables that will be passed to the executed command.

## packageFilters

The [`melos exec`](/commands/exec) command allows you to execute a command for
multiple packages. When used in a script, you can declare filter options in the
`packageFilters` section.

The `hello_flutter` script below is only executed in Flutter packages:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello_flutter:
    exec: echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'
    packageFilters:
      flutter: true
```

See the [global options](/filters) for a list of supported filters.

<Warning>
  The filter names in `packageFilters` are camel cased. For example, for the
  equivalent of the command line option `--file-exists` use `fileExists`.
</Warning>

When running a script that uses `packageFilters`, you will be prompted to select
the package to execute the script in. If you want to skip this prompt and run
the script in all packages, use the `--no-select` option.

## Hooks

Certain Melos commands support running scripts before and after the command is
executed, as well as at other interesting points in the command's execution.

All commands that support hooks, support at least the `pre` and `post` hook.

Hooks are configured in the `hooks` section of a command's configuration in the
`melos.yaml` file.

```yaml
command:
  bootstrap:
    hooks:
      pre: echo `bootstrap command is running...`
      post: echo `bootstrap command is done`
```

Currently, the following Melos commands support hooks:

- [`bootstrap`](/commands/bootstrap)
- [`clean`](/commands/clean)
- [`version`](/commands/version)
- [`publish`](/commands/publish)
