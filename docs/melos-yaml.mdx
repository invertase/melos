# melos.yaml

Every project requires a `melos.yaml` project in the root. The below outlines
all of the specific fields and their purpose.

## `name`

The name of this project, using for display purposes within IO environments and IDEs.

```yaml
name: My Awesome Project
```

## `repository`

The URL of where the git repository, which contains this project, is centraly hosted.

Supported hosts:

- GitHub

```yaml
repository: https://github.com/invertase/melos
```

## `packages`

A list of local packages Melos will use to execute commands against.  The list can be
of specific paths or a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern expansion format.

```yaml
packages:
  - packages/**
  - ext/some_other_package
```

If you only have a single package, that you want to use Melos for and `melos.yaml` is at the root of
that package, use the single directory glob pattern (the quotes are important):

```yaml
packages:
  - '*'
```

## `ignore`

A list of specific paths or [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) patterns to substract
from the paths declared in [`packages`](#packages).

## `scripts`

A list of scripts, that can be executed with `melos run` or will be executed before/after some
specific melos commands.

With the simple syntax, only the name of the srcript and the command to execute needs to be specified:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello: echo 'Hello World'
```

The extends syntax allows for a more complex configuration of a script:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    name: hey
    description: 'Greet the world'
    run: echo '$GREETING World'
    env:
      GREETING: 'Hey'
```

### Hooks

Certain Melos commands support running scripts before and after the command is executed.
Before hooks have the same name as the command. Post hooks have the name of the command prefixed with `post`:

```yaml
scripts:
  bootstrap: echo `bootstrap command is running...`
  postbootstrap: echo `bootstrap command is done`
```

Currently, the following Melos commands support hooks:

- `bootstrap`
- `clean`
- `version`

## `scripts/*/name`

A unique identifier for the script.

## `scripts/*/description`

A short description, shown when using `melos run` with no argument.

## `scripts/*/run`

The command to execute.

## `scripts/*/env`

A map of environment variables that will be passed to the executed command.

## `scripts/*/select-package`

The `melos exec` command allows you to execute a command for multiple packages. When used
in a script, you can declare filter options in the `select-packages` section.

The `hello_flutter` script below is only executed in Flutter packages:

```yaml
scripts:
  hello_flutter:
    run: melos exec -- "echo 'Hello $(dirname $PWD)'"
    select-package:
      flutter: true
```

See the [global options](/commands#global-options) for a list of supported filters.

## `command/version/message`

A template for the commit message, that is generated by `melos version`.

Templates must use mustache syntax and have the following variables available:

- `new_package_versions`: A list of the versioned packages and their new versions.

The default is:
```
chore(release): publish packages

{new_package_versions}
```

```yaml
command:
  version:
    message: |
      chore: cut package releases ðŸŽ‰

      {new_package_versions}
```

## `command/version/linkToCommits`

Whether to add links to commits in the CHANGELOG.md, that is generated by `melos version`.

Enabling this option, requries [`repository`](#repository) to be specified.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    linkToCommits: true
```

## `command/version/branch`

If specified, prevents `melos version` from being used inside branches other than the one specified.

```yaml
command:
  version:
    branch: main
```
