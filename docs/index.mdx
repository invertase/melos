## About

Melos is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool used
to help manage Dart projects with multiple packages (also known as mono-repos).
It is in active development and is in use on projects such as
[FlutterFire](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire).

Splitting up large code bases into separate independently versioned packages is
extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many
repositories is messy and difficult to track, and testing across repositories
gets complicated. Melos helps solve these issues by allowing multiple packages
to work together within one repository, whilst being totally independent of each
other. Features include:

- Automatic versioning & changelog generation.
- Automated publishing of packages to pub.dev.
- Local package linking and installation.
- Executing simultaneous commands across packages.
- Listing of local packages & their dependencies.

Melos also works great on CI/CD environments to help automate complex tasks and
challenges.
