  Conventional Commits.

# Automated Releases

Melos is able to automate **versioning** and **publishing** of your packages.

This includes:

- incrementing of versions based on commit messages.
- updating version constraints of dependents.
- generating of changelogs.
- running versioning hook scripts.
- update package version tags in git dependencies.
- publishing of packages to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Versioning

Packages can be versioned automatically based on their commit history. For this
to work, Melos needs to be able to parse commit messages and detect exactly what
sort of version upgrade is required. Melos understands
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), a widely
used specification for commit messages which are readable by humans and
machines.

Alternatively, packages can be versioned manually by specifing a version
increase (`major`, `minor`, `patch` or `build`) or an exact version.

For customizing the versioning process, see the
[configuration options](/configuration/overview#commandversion) for the
`version` command.

### Automatic Versioning

To determine which packages to version and how, Melos performs the following
steps:

1. Apply [filters](/filters) to the list of workspace packages.
2. Load the commit history for each package. If the `--diff` option is
   specified, Melos will only load the specified commit. Otherwise it will load
   all commits since the last version tag (e.g. `foo-v1.0.0`).
3. Parse commit messages as Conventional Commits. If a commit message does not
   follow the Conventional Commits specification, it will be ignored.
4. Filter out commits with types that don't trigger a version bump. For example,
   `chore` commits will be ignored.
5. If at this point no commits remain, the package will not be versioned.
6. Determine the version upgrade required for each package based on the commit
   with the most significant version bump. For example, if a package has a
   `feat` commit and a `fix` commit, the package will be versioned with a
   `minor` upgrade.

#### Conventional Commits

Currently the following commit types trigger a version bump:

- `docs` - A documentation change.
- `feat` - A new feature.
- `fix` - A bug fix.
- `bug` - A bug fix.
- `perf` - A change that improves performance.
- `refactor` - A change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `revert` - A change that reverts a previous commit.

The first matching rule in the list below determines the version bump for a
commit:

1. A breaking change will trigger a **major** version bump.
2. A feature will trigger a **minor** version bump.
3. All other changes will trigger a **patch** version bump.

Melos supports prefixes (like `Merge ...` and `Merged ...` for example) before
the conventional commit type. This is useful since some collaborative version
control systems use these non-configurable prefixes when they merge pull
requests.

#### Not using Conventional Commits?

If an existing Git project is already established and does not use Conventional
Commits, it is still possible to adopt the convention and use Melos for future
releases.

Just start writing commit messages that follow Conventional Commits. When you
are ready to release a package for the first time with Melos use [manual
versioning](/guides/automated-releases#manual-versioning). This will ensure that the version increment is
appropriate for all commits, including those that Melos cannot interpret.

Once you have manullay versioning every packages at least once, you can savely
use automatic versioning.

### Manual Versioning

Manual versioning allows you to specify a version increment (`major`, `minor`,
`patch` or `build`) or an exact version for one or more packages.

If you only want to manually version a single package, you can use the following
syntax:

```sh
melos version <package-name> <version-change>
```

To manually version multiple packages use the `--manual-version` (short `-V`)
option:

```sh
melos version --manual-version <package-1-name>:<version-change> --manual-version <package-2-name>:<version-change>
# Same but with short version
melos version -V <package-1-name>:<version-change> -V <package-2-name>:<version-change>
```

Note that when using the `--manual-version` option, the automatic versioning
process is executed normally, except for the packages that are manually
versioned. It allows to mix automatic and manual versioning. The
[`--ignore`](/filters#--ignore) filter can be used to exclude all packages from
automatic versioning, by passing `--ignore '*'`.

### Dependents Versioning

By default, Melos also updates the constraints in the `pubspec.yaml` files of
dependents of the packages that were versioned. This can be disabled by passing
`--no-dependent-constraints`.

If such a dependent is not already being versioned, a **patch** version bump
will be created for it. This can be disabled by passing
`--no-dependent-versions`.

Note that dependents of versioned packages are not filtered by the specified
package filters.

### Committing and Tagging Version Changes

After updating the `pubspec.yaml` files and changelogs of the versioned
packages, Melos will commit the changes and add a package version tag for each
package.

Package version tags have the format `<package-name>-v<version>`.

This behavior can be disabled by passing `--no-git-tag-version`.

#### Hook

After updating `pubspec.yaml` files and changelogs but before creating the
version commit, the `command/version/hooks/preCommit` script in `melos.yaml` is
executed. This allows you to run custom code before the version commit is
created.

Note that you have to stage changes that you make in the hook and want to have
included in the version commit yourself.

### Changelog

Melos updates the changelog for each package that is versioned by prepending a
section for the new version. You can disable this behavior by passing
`--no-changelog`.

See the [configuration options](/configuration/overview#commandversion) for the
`version` command for customizing changelog generation.

Melos can also write a
[workspace changelog](/configuration/overview#workspacechangelog). This is
enabled by default.

## Publishing

To publish packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) you must:

1. Have permission to publish all the packages.
2. Be on a machine which is authenticated with Pub.

<Info>Internally, Melos uses `pub publish` to publish the packages.</Info>

Once you have [versioned](/guides/automated-releases#versioning) your packages,
run the publish command to check everything is good to go:

```sh
melos publish
```

By default, a dry-run is performed (nothing will be published).

Once satisfied with your pending releases, release them to
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev):

```sh
melos publish --no-dry-run
```

## Releases

Melos can generate a link to the prefilled release creation page.

To enable this once use one of the following arguments to `melos version`:

```sh
melos version --release-url
melos version -r
```

To enable this feature permanently, add the following to your `melos.yaml`:

```yaml
command:
  version:
    releaseUrl: true
```

## Git Hosted Packages

If your packages are private and you don't publish them to
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev), you can use package version tags as git reference in
your `pubspec.yaml` files and Melos will ensure that the tags are updated
accordingly.

To use this feature enable
[`command/version/updateGitTagRefs`](/configuration/overview#updategittagrefs)
in `melos.yaml`

Take the following git dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  internal_dep:
    git:
      url: git@github.com:org/repo.git
      path: packages/internal_dep
      ref: internal_dep-v0.0.1
```

When creating a patch release for `internal_dep` through `melos version` the
`ref` would be updated to the new version:

```yaml
dependencies:
  internal_dep:
    git:
      url: git@github.com:org/repo.git
      path: packages/internal_dep
      ref: internal_dep-v0.0.2
```
