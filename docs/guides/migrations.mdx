# Migrations

## 2.0.0 to 3.0.0

### Local package linking with `pubspec_overrides.yaml`

The initial mechanism used by Melos to link local packages for development had
some issues when interacting with other tooling. An often-encountered error is
"The pubspec.yaml file has changed since the pubspec.lock file was generated"
([#117](https://github.com/invertase/melos/issues/117)).

To resolve this issue, an alternative mechanism has been implemented which
generates `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files in the root of each package, for which
dependencies need to be overridden. Before Melos 3.0.0, this mechanism had to be
opted into by setting `command/bootstrap/usePubspecOverrides` in `melos.yaml` to
`true`.

This is now the only mechanism used by Melos and the `usePubspecOverrides`
configuration option has been removed.

Typically `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files should be ignored by git. To ignore
these files, add the following to your `.gitignore` file:

```
pubspec_overrides.yaml
```

### `--since` was removed in favour of `--diff`

The `--since` flag was removed in favour of `--diff`, which is more flexible and
can be used to specify a range of commits in addition to a single commit.

To migrate from `--since` to `--diff` simply replace `--since` with `--diff`.

### Options that are now enabled by default

The following options which were previously set to `false` by default are now
set to `true` by default:

- `command/version/includeScopes`
- `command/version/linkToCommits`, if `repository` is configured
- `command/version/workspaceChangelog`
