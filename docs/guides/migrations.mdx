# Migrations

## 3.0.0 to 4.0.0

### `--no-git-tag-version` behavior change

If you were previously using `--no-git-tag-version` and were relying on that it
didn't create a commit you now have to also pass `--no-git-commit-version` to
prevent a commit from being automatically created after versioning.

## 2.0.0 to 3.0.0

### Versioning of Melos in workspaces

From Melos 3.0.0, the version of Melos to use in any given workspace must be
specified in a `pubspec.yaml` file next to the `melos.yaml` file, in the
workspace root directory.

Different Melos workspaces might use different versions of Melos. To ensure
everyone working in the workspace (as well as CI jobs) is using the same version
of Melos, a dependency on the `melos` package has to be added to the
`pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root directory. The globally installed
version of Melos will switch to the version specified in the `pubspec.yaml`
file, if both versions are not the same.

If you don't have a `pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root yet, create one
now:

```yaml
name: my_project_workspace

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'
```

The corresponding `pubspec.lock` file should also be committed. Make sure to
exclude it from the `.gitignore` file.

Add Melos as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
dart pub add melos --dev
```

### Local package linking with `pubspec_overrides.yaml`

The initial mechanism used by Melos to link local packages for development had
some issues when interacting with other tooling. An often-encountered error is
"The pubspec.yaml file has changed since the pubspec.lock file was generated"
([#117](https://github.com/invertase/melos/issues/117)).

To resolve this issue, an alternative mechanism has been implemented which
generates `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files in the root of each package, for which
dependencies need to be overridden. Before Melos 3.0.0, this mechanism had to be
opted into by setting `command/bootstrap/usePubspecOverrides` in `melos.yaml` to
`true`.

This is now the only mechanism used by Melos and the `usePubspecOverrides`
configuration option has been removed.

Typically `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files should be ignored by git. To ignore
these files, add the following to your `.gitignore` file:

```
pubspec_overrides.yaml
```

### `--since` was removed in favour of `--diff`

The `--since` flag was removed in favour of `--diff`, which is more flexible and
can be used to specify a range of commits in addition to a single commit.

To migrate from `--since` to `--diff` simply replace `--since` with `--diff`.

### Changed option defaults

The following options are now enabled by default:

- [`command/version/includeScopes`](/configuration/overview#includescopes)
- [`command/version/linkToCommits`](/configuration/overview#linktocommits), if
  [`repository`](/configuration/overview#repository) is configured
- [`command/version/workspaceChangelog`](/configuration/overview#workspacechangelog)

### Lifecycle hooks

Lifecycle hooks have been moved to the respective command configurations.
Previously, hooks were defined in `scripts`. The `pre` hook had the same name as
the command, and the `post` hook had the name of the command with `post`
appended. Now, hooks are defined in `command/<name>/hooks`.

- `bootstrap` -> `command/bootstrap/hooks/pre`
- `postbootstrap` -> `command/bootstrap/hooks/post`
- `clean` -> `command/clean/hooks/pre`
- `postclean` -> `command/clean/hooks/post`
- `version` -> `command/version/hooks/preCommit`
- `postversion` -> `command/version/hooks/post`

#### Version command hooks

The `version` hook was previously executed during versioning, before the version
commit was created. The `pre` hook is now executed before the `version` command,
like for all other commands.

The new `preCommit` hook is executed before the version commit is created and is
the equivalent of the previous `version` hook.

### Package filters

The `select-package` option for scripts has been renamed to
[`packageFilters`](/configuration/scripts#packagefilters). This brings it in
line with
[`command/version/changelogs/packageFilters`](/configuration/overview#packagefilters).

The names of filters specified in `packageFilters` are now camel cased instead
of kebab cased.

For example, take the following `test` script configuration:

```yaml
scripts:
  test:
    exec: dart test
    packageFilters:
      dirExists: test
```

This would previously have been written as:

```yaml
scripts:
  test:
    exec: dart test
    select-package:
      dir-exists: test
```
