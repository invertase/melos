# Getting Started

Melos requires a few one-off steps to be completed before you can start using
it.

## Pub Workspaces

First start by reading the short Pub Workspaces guide for how to get your
monorepo ready to be used with Melos and Pub Workspaces, the guide can be
found on the [Dart website](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/workspaces).

## Installation

Install Melos as a
[global package](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#running-a-script-from-your-path)
via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) so it can be used from anywhere on your system:

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

<Warning>
  If using Git Bash on Windows, `melos` will not be callable directly as it
  will have a `*.bat` extension. You can update your `~/.bash_profile` with
  the following function to call melos with arguments:

  ```bash
  function melos() {
    melos.bat $@
  }
  ```
</Warning>

## Setup a workspace

Melos is designed to work with a workspace. A workspace is a directory which
contains all the packages that are going to be developed together. Its root
directory must contain a `pubspec.yaml` file defining the workspace.

### Recommended directory structure

When using Melos it's recommended to not have an app/package in the root of the
workspace, since that is where the configuration for the workspace will live.
If you want to you can still do it though, and Melos will work just fine, when
using `useRootAsPackage: true` it is even required, see
[here](/configuration/overview#userootaspackage).

The following is the recommended workspace directory structure:

```console
my_project
├── apps
│   ├── apps_1
│   └── apps_2
├── packages
│   ├── package_1
│   └── package_2
├── pubspec.yaml
└── README.md
```

### Install Melos in the workspace

Different Melos workspaces might use different versions of Melos. To ensure
everyone working in the workspace (as well as CI jobs) is using the same version
of Melos, a dependency on the `melos` package has to be added to the
`pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root directory. The globally installed
version of Melos will switch to the version specified in the `pubspec.yaml`
file, if both versions are not the same.

If you don't have a `pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root yet, create one
now:

```yaml
name: my_project
publish_to: none
environment:
  sdk: ^3.9.0
workspace:
  - packages/helper
  - packages/client_package
  - packages/server_package
```

Where `packages/helper`, `packages/client_package` and `packages/server_package`
are the paths to the packages in your workspace.

The corresponding `pubspec.lock` file should also be committed. Make sure to
exclude it from the `.gitignore` file.

Add Melos as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
dart pub add melos --dev
```

### Configure your packages

Next, in all your packages `pubspec.yaml` files, add the
`resolution: workspace` field:

```yaml
name: my_package
resolution: workspace

...
```

## Bootstrapping

Once installed & setup, Melos needs to be bootstrapped. Bootstrapping has
three primary functions:

1. Installing all package dependencies (internally using `pub get`).
2. Syncing shared dependencies between packages.
3. Running any bootstrap lifecycle scripts.

Bootstrap your project by running the following command:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

If you wonder why bootstrapping is needed you can read more about it in the
[Bootstrap section](/commands/bootstrap).

## Single package projects (non-monorepo)

Melos can also be used for single package projects to leverage its features
like versioning, publishing, and changelog generation. This is useful when you
want to use Melos tools but don't have a monorepo structure.

For single package setup, just add `useRootAsPackage: true` to your 
`pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my_single_package
publish_to: none
environment:
  sdk: ^3.9.0

dev_dependencies:
  melos: ^7.0.0

melos:
  useRootAsPackage: true
```

## Next steps

Once successfully bootstrapped, you can develop your packages side-by-side with
changes to a single package immediately reflecting across other dependent
packages.

Melos also provides other helpful features such as running scripts across all
packages. For example, to run dart analyzer in each package, add a new `script`
item in your root `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my_workspace

...

melos:
  scripts:
    generate:
      run: melos exec -c 1 --depends-on build_runner -- dart run build_runner build
```

Then execute the command by running `melos generate`.

If you're looking for some inspiration as to what scripts can help with, check
out the
[FlutterFire repository](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/blob/main/pubspec.yaml)
or the [Flame repository](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/pubspec.yaml).

If you are using VS Code, there is an [extension](/ide-support#vs-code)
available, to integrate Melos with VS Code.
