# Getting Started

Melos requires a few one-off steps to be completed before you can start using
it.

## Installation

Install Melos as a
[global package](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#running-a-script-from-your-path)
via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) so it can be used from anywhere on your system:

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

## Setup a workspace

Melos is designed to work with a workspace. A workspace is a directory which
contains all the packages that are going to be developed together. Its root
directory must contain a `melos.yaml` and a `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Recommended directory structure

When using Melos you shouldn't have a project in the root of the workspace,
since that is where the configuration for the workspace will live and those
dependencies might clash with your project dependencies.

The following is the recommended workspace directory structure:

```console
my_project
├── apps
│   ├── apps_1
│   └── apps_2
├── packages
│   ├── package_1
│   └── package_2
├── melos.yaml
├── pubspec.yaml
└── README.md
```

### Install Melos in the workspace

Different Melos workspaces might use different versions of Melos. To ensure
everyone working in the workspace (as well as CI jobs) is using the same version
of Melos, a dependency on the `melos` package has to be added to the
`pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root directory. The globally installed
version of Melos will switch to the version specified in the `pubspec.yaml`
file, if both versions are not the same.

If you don't have a `pubspec.yaml` file at the workspace root yet, create one
now:

```yaml
name: my_project

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'
```

The corresponding `pubspec.lock` file should also be committed. Make sure to
exclude it from the `.gitignore` file.

Add Melos as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
dart pub add melos --dev
```

### Configure the workspace

Next create a `melos.yaml` file at the repository root. Within the `melos.yaml`
file, add the `name` and `packages` fields:

```yaml
name: my_project

packages:
  - apps/**
  - packages/**
```

The `packages` list should contain paths to the individual packages within your
project. Each path can be defined using the
[glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern expansion format.

Melos generates `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files to link local packages for
development. Typically these files should be ignored by git. To ignore these
files, add the following to your `.gitignore` file:

```
pubspec_overrides.yaml
```

## Bootstrapping

Once installed & setup, Melos needs to be bootstrapped. Bootstrapping has 2
primary roles:

1. Installing all package dependencies (internally using `pub get`).
2. Locally linking any packages together.

Bootstrap your project by running the following command: 

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

### Why do I need to bootstrap?

In normal projects, packages can be linked by providing a `path` within the
`pubspec.yaml`. This works for small projects however presents a problem at
scale. Packages cannot be published with a locally defined path, meaning once
you're ready to publish your packages you'll need to manually update all the
packages `pubspec.yaml` files with the versions. If your packages are also
tightly coupled (dependencies of each other), you'll also have to manually check
which versions should be updated. Even with a few packages this can become a
long and error-prone task.

Melos solves this problem by overriding local files which the Dart analyzer uses
to read packages from. If a local package exists (defined in the `melos.yaml`
file) and a different local package has it listed as a dependency, it will be
linked regardless of whether a version has been specified.

## Next steps

Once successfully bootstrapped, you can develop your packages side-by-side with
changes to a single package immediately reflecting across other dependent
packages.

Melos also provides other helpful features such as running scripts across all
packages. For example, to run dart analyzer in each package, add a new `script`
item in your `melos.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my_project

packages:
  - apps/**
  - packages/**

scripts:
  analyze:
    exec: dart analyze .
```

Then execute the command by running `melos run analyze`.

If you're looking for some inspiration as to what scripts can help with, check
out the
[FlutterFire repository](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/blob/master/melos.yaml).

If you are using VS Code, there is an [extension](/ide-support#vs-code)
available, to integrate Melos with VS Code.
