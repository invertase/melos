## VS Code

The [Melos extension][melos-code] integrates Melos with VS Code.

### `melos.yaml`

The extension provides validation and autocompletion of `melos.yaml` and allows
you to run scripts through CodeLenses:

To configure a task that run a Melos script, use task type `melos`:

```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "melos",
      "script": "test",
      "label": "melos: test"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Commands

The following commands are available in the command palette:

- `Melos: Bootstrap` to run `melos bootstrap`
- `Melos: Clean` to run `melos clean`
- `Melos: Run script` to select and run a Melos script
